<Accordion title="Can I have my own priority scene?">
  <Check>
    Absolutely!
  </Check>
  At **Norfolk Southern State Roleplay**, you do **not** need to request or get approval for a priority scene. This allows roleplays to stay realistic and spontaneous!

  Before starting a priority scene:

  1. Make sure there is **no priority timer** currently active.
  2. Ensure your scene follows all **server rules** and has **enough players** to keep the roleplay engaging and practical.

  <Danger>
    **Only one priority scene at a time!**

    To maintain quality and ensure enough participants, only **one priority scene** can happen at a time.\
    If another scene is already in progress, you <u>cannot</u> start a new one!
  </Danger>
  <Accordion title="What is a priority timer?" icon="timer">
    A **priority timer** is a countdown that appears on the side of your game screen whenever a priority scene is active.

    **No new priority scenes should begin until the timer is offline.**

    This system prevents multiple priority scenes from happening back-to-back and keeps the roleplay balanced.
