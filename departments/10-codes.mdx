# 📡 NLE Radio — 10-Codes, Phonetic Alphabet & Priorities

This page is the **authoritative, quick-reference guide** for Norfolk Law Enforcement (NLE) radio communications.\
Use it when operating on the **NLE Radio** voice channel to ensure clear, professional, and realistic transmissions.

<Check>
  This page focuses on how to _use_ the codes and apply them in realistic radio traffic. For NLE unit procedures and resources, see **NLE Resources** (separate page).

      - Use your **unit ID** (e.g., `118`) on all transmissions.
      - Pause **1–2 seconds** before transmitting to avoid overlaps.
      - Yield the channel immediately for **BREAK, BREAK, BREAK** or **Signal 100** transmissions.
      - Acknowledge critical info with **10-4**.

      - **11-99 / 10-99** — Officer Down / Officer in Distress — _EXTREME EMERGENCY_. All units respond.
      - **10-13** — Shots Fired. Request immediate backup & EMS.
      - **10-80 / 10-70** — Pursuits / Foot Pursuits — declare **Signal 100** if multi-unit and high risk.

        Below is a consolidated table of the most commonly used police 10-codes in NLE traffic. Use them frequently to maintain immersion and brevity.

        | Code  | Meaning                                      |
        | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
        | 11-99 | Officer down — extreme emergency only        |
        | 10-99 | Officer in distress — extreme emergency only |
        | 10-13 | Shots fired                                  |
        | 10-80 | Vehicle pursuit                              |

        <Tip>
          Reserve **11-99 / 10-99** for real emergencies only. False use will confuse units and will result in disciplinary action.

## 🧭 Radio Transmission Structure & Examples

Use the patterns below to maintain consistent, professional transmissions.

### 1) **Self-Dispatch (No Dispatch Involved)**

````

\[Unit ID] to self-dispatch: \[Short message]
Example: 118 to self-dispatch: 10-8, patrolling downtown.

```

### 2) **With Dispatch**
```

\[Unit ID] to dispatch.
(Wait for dispatch: "Go ahead.")
\[Unit ID]: \[Message]
Example:
118 to dispatch.
Dispatch: Go ahead.
118: 10-76 en route to Route 9, ETA 3 minutes.

```

### 3) **Emergency Interrupt (Break)**
```

Break, break, break! Officer down at 4th & Main, 11-99, requesting immediate EMS and all available units!

```

### 4) **Signal 100 Declaration**
```

Dispatch: Signal 100 in effect for downtown — hold all non-emergency transmissions.

```

<Warning>
When making multi-part transmissions, pause between sections and wait for acknowledgments (10-4) before proceeding with additional info.
</Warning>

## ✅ Best Practices & Do's / Don'ts

| Do | Don’t |
|----|-------|
| Speak clearly, slowly, and in short phrases | Ramble or read long blocks of text |
| Pause 1–2 seconds before pressing to avoid cutoffs | Transmit immediately on top of another user |
| Use phonetic alphabet for plates, partial IDs, or unclear letters | Spell letters without phonetics in noisy channels |
| Acknowledge receipts with **10-4** | Ignore critical transmissions (BREAK / Signal 100) |
| Keep non-essential chatter off the radio | Use radio for casual conversation or banter |

<Note>
If unsure about a code or procedure during live incidents, default to plain language: state location, nature of incident, and requested resources.
</Note>

## 🔁 Advanced Tips (Realism & Teamwork)

- **Radio Discipline:** Reserve the radio for operational traffic; coordinate non-critical logistics via Discord text or designated VCs.  
- **Controlled Repeats:** If you didn't copy, request **10-9** rather than guessing.  
- **Self-Check:** Periodically transmit **10-4**/status updates so command knows your availability.  
- **Relay Protocols:** If comms are congested, use relay units to pass information (e.g., a supervisor repeating critical info).

<Danger>
Never use real-world emergency tactics or impersonate real emergency services beyond the roleplay scope — stay within server rules and role responsibilities.
</Danger>

## 🔚 Final Note

Mastering the radio elevates both your effectiveness and the server’s immersion. Practice these transmissions, learn the phonetic alphabet, and respect priority rules — your team and the community will run smoother for it.

<Check>
When in doubt on the air: **keep it short, keep it clear, and yield for higher priority traffic.**
