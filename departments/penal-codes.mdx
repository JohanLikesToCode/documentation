## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Roleplay Use

<Info>
  - These codes serve as **RP reference** for NLE Law Enforcement, courts, and dispatchers.
  - Not every real-world law is included ‚Äî this is a **streamlined version** for practical gameplay.
</Info>

<Tip>
  When in doubt during a scene, use **plain language** alongside the code. Example:\
  `10-23, 602 trespassing in progress at gas station. Two civilians refusing to leave.`
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Do not memorize codes blindly.** Focus on the ones most frequently used in RP:

  - 187 (Homicide), 211 (Robbery), 240 (Assault), 459 (Burglary), 484/487/488 (Thefts),
  - 10851 (Stolen Vehicle), 23103 (Reckless Driving), 23512 (DUI), 11350/11377 (Drug Possession).
</Warning>

<Danger>
  **Misuse of penal codes** (e.g., spamming wrong codes or overusing severe charges) will result in administrative moderation or removal from law enforcement roles.
</Danger>
