## ⚠️ Notes for Roleplay Use

<Info>
  - These codes serve as **RP reference** for NLE Law Enforcement, courts, and dispatchers.
  - Not every real-world law is included — this is a **streamlined version** for gameplay.
</Info>

<Tip>
  When in doubt during a scene, use **plain language** alongside the code. Example:\
  `10-23, 602 trespassing in progress at gas station. Two civilians refusing to leave.`
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Focus on the most common codes** for fluid roleplay:\
  187 (Homicide), 211 (Robbery), 240 (Assault), 459 (Burglary),\
  484/487/488 (Thefts), 10851 (Stolen Vehicle), 23103 (Reckless Driving),\
  23512 (DUI), 11350/11377 (Drug Possession).
</Warning>

<Danger>
  **Misuse of penal codes** (e.g., spamming wrong codes or inflating charges)\
  will result in **administrative moderation** or removal from law enforcement roles.
</Danger>
