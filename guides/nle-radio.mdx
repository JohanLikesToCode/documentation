# 📻 NLE Radio Communication Guide

In **Norfolk Law Enforcement (NLE)**, communication is the **backbone of effective operations**. Officers are expected to use the **Discord voice channel “NLE Radio”** as their primary communication line, simulating a **real-world police radio** system.

This guide explains how to communicate **clearly, efficiently, and professionally** on the radio, including the use of **10-codes, priority breaks, status updates, and dispatch interactions**.

---

## 🎙️ Radio Etiquette

### Core Principles

- **Clarity:** Speak slowly and clearly. Avoid background noise.
- **Brevity:** Be concise; radio time is limited.
- **Respect Priority:** Allow urgent transmissions to interrupt yours.
- **Professionalism:** Stay in-character, using codes and proper terminology.

<Check>
  Every officer represents NLE on the air. Clear radio communication ensures **safety, efficiency, and immersion**.

## 🔹 Basic Radio Structure

### Without Dispatch (Self-Dispatching)

- Format:

```

\[Unit ID] to self-dispatch: \[Message]
```

- Example:

```

118 to self-dispatch: 10-8, active patrol around downtown.
```

### With Dispatch

- Format:

```

\[Unit ID] to dispatch
```

_Wait for dispatch acknowledgment_

```

Dispatch: Go ahead.
\[Unit ID]: \[Message]
```

- Example:

```

118 to dispatch.
Dispatch: Go ahead.
118: 10-8, starting patrol in county jurisdiction.
```

## 🚨 Priority Breaks & Emergencies

Sometimes an urgent situation requires **breaking radio traffic**:

### Break Break Break

- Used when you must interrupt all transmissions immediately.
- Example:

```

Break, break, break! Shots fired, 10-32, requesting backup at the suburbs!
```

### Signal 100

- Declares **restricted radio traffic**: only emergency or high-priority messages are allowed.
- Example:

```

Signal 100 is now in effect—stand by unless urgent.
```

<Accordion title="When to Call a Signal 100" icon="warning">
  - Active shooter
  - Pursuit involving multiple units
  - Officer down or needs urgent assistance
  - Major in-progress felony
</Accordion>

## 📊 Unit Status Codes

Clear unit status keeps the channel organized. Always announce your status when it changes.

- **10-8:** In service, available for calls
- **10-6:** Busy, not available
- **10-7:** Out of service
- **10-23:** Arrived on scene
- **10-76:** En route to a call
- **10-97:** Arrived at location (alternative to 10-23)
- **Code 4:** Scene is under control / no further assistance needed

**Example Transmission:**

```

118 to dispatch: 10-23 at traffic stop, Highway 55.
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

- **Pause Before Speaking:** Wait 1–2 seconds before transmitting to avoid cutting off.
- **Acknowledge Calls:** Always confirm you’ve received important info with “10-4.”
- **Avoid Overlapping:** Listen before keying up—don’t talk over others.
- **Prioritize Emergencies:** If a break or signal 100 is called, **immediately yield the channel**.
- **Stay Calm:** Even under stress, maintain a steady and professional tone.

---

## 📝 Quick Reminders

- Always use your **unit ID**, not your Roblox username.
- Don’t overuse radio chatter; keep transmissions **relevant**.
- Treat dispatch with respect—follow their direction unless unsafe.
- When in doubt, **ask for clarification**: “10-9?”

<Warning>
  Violating these practises can lead to a **server mute**.

  _Server Mutes can be enforced by a dispatcher or a Norfolk Staff Member_
