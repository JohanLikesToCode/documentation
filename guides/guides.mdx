## üé≠ Understanding Roleplay

Roleplay (RP) is the act of assuming a character and acting in accordance with that character‚Äôs personality, role, and goals. In NSSRP:

- Players can take on roles such as **Law Enforcement, EMS, Fire, Civilians**, or specialized positions during events.
- Each role has **specific responsibilities, limitations, and tools** to maintain realism.
- RP is about **collaborative storytelling**, where actions and consequences are logical and believable.

### Key Principles:

- **Consistency:** Your character‚Äôs actions should align with their role.
- **Believability:** Avoid unrealistic actions that break immersion (e.g., random deaths, instant arrests without process).
- **Engagement:** Interact with other players‚Äô characters meaningfully.

## üíº Preparing Your Character

Before participating in roleplay, you should define your character and understand your role:

1. **Character Background**
   - Decide your character‚Äôs **age, occupation, and personality traits**.
   - Think about **goals and motivations** to make interactions meaningful.
   - Avoid creating a character that conflicts with server rules or realism.
2. **Understanding Your Role**
   - Each role comes with **responsibilities**:
     - **Law Enforcement:** Maintain law and order, respond to crimes, issue citations, and investigate incidents.
     - **EMS/Fire:** Provide medical assistance, respond to emergencies, and ensure public safety.
     - **Civilian Roles:** Participate in daily life, operate businesses, and engage in realistic scenarios. Else become unemployed and live life what way you want to.
     - **Criminal: **Break the law and survive through the fleet of law enforcement units trying to hunt you down!
   - Learn the **tools, commands, and protocols** associated with your role to avoid mistakes.
3. **Preparing Equipment and Vehicles**
   - Ensure you know how to operate **vehicles, radios, and other in-game and Discord tools**.

## üìù Starting a Roleplay Scene

Roleplay scenes are the core of NSSRP. Here‚Äôs how to approach them effectively:

1. **Identify Opportunities**
   - Look for situations in-game that could evolve into a story.
   - Example: a civilian calls for medical assistance, a crime occurs, or a traffic accident happens.
2. **Communicate Clearly**
   - Use in-character speech and actions to describe what your character is doing.
   - Avoid breaking character or using **OOC (Out of Character) chat** during active scenes.
3. **Collaboration**
   - Coordinate with other players to ensure a **smooth and realistic scene**.
   - Join appropriate voice channels within the Discord to communicate with other roleplayers.
   - Law Enforcement and EMS often need to communicate via radios voice channels.
   - Civilians should follow instructions but add flavor to the scenario with dialogue and reactions.
4. **Roleplay Flow**
   - Start the scene gradually; avoid jumping straight to extreme actions.
   - Give each participant a chance to contribute.
   - Always consider consequences‚Äîyour character‚Äôs actions should have realistic outcomes.

## üö® Handling Priority Scenes

Priority scenes are **major events** that require multiple players and full attention.

<Accordion title="Priority Scene Guidelines" icon="sparkles">
  - Only **one priority scene** can occur at a time.
  - Check the **priority timer** before starting a scene.
  - Make sure your scene is **practical** and has **enough participants**.
  - Roles should **adhere strictly to responsibilities** to maintain realism.

  <Danger>
    **Important:** Never start a priority scene while another is in progress. Doing so can disrupt ongoing events and reduce immersion.
  </Danger>
</Accordion>

### Role Coordination

- Law Enforcement should assign officers to specific tasks (traffic, investigation, backup).
- EMS should organize triage, treatment, and transport of injured players.
- Civilians must react realistically, providing context and enhancing the story.

## üí¨ Communication in RP

Effective communication is crucial in RP:

1. **In-Character Speech**
   - Speak and act as your character would.
   - Use clear descriptions of actions, e.g., ‚Äú_\*grabs gun\*_‚Äù or _"\*searches car\*"_
2. **Non-Verbal Cues**
   - Use emotes or gestures where possible.
   - Actions like hand signals, vehicle positioning, and interaction with props enhance immersion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Handling Challenges

Even with preparation, RP scenes can encounter challenges.

<Accordion title="Common RP Challenges" icon="warning">
  - **Uncooperative Players:** Politely remind them to follow RP rules. If needed, involve staff.
  - **Overcrowded Scenes:** Pause or delay extra participants to maintain realism.
  - **Technical Issues:** Lag or glitches can disrupt RP. Do not attempt them. You might get moderated if this is seen to be deliberate by staff.
</Accordion>

### Conflict Resolution

- Avoid meta-gaming or using real-life knowledge in RP scenarios.
- Handle disagreements **in-character**, or consult staff **in Mod Scene VCs **if necessary.
- Respect the decisions of roleplay leads and scene coordinators.
